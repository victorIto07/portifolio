For the time I have been learning to code, my main inspiration to learn more and more was to merge fun with knownledge. So, throughout the years I've made some little projects in some different languages and libraries wich was certanly the way I've learned the most. In this repo, I'm just displaying some of those little projects as a (sort of) showcase.

## Python
This was the first language that I came across when trying to "learn how to code". I saw that it's capable of doing muiltiple stuff with a friendly learning curve.


Most of my time learning was spent with Python for it's simplicity. So, when I come across a new thing, even nowdays, I tend to have my first contact with it with Python.


Most of my projects are graphical ones becouse, as I said, I like learning by having fun. So if you want to have a look on the files, I highly recomend installing some of those libraries to be able to:

```bash
$ pip install pygame pynput pyautogui opencv-python
```

## NodeJS
I stumbled across NodeJS after my fist job, where it was pretty much **needed** since I was going to use Angular.js, and express in the backend.


Because of de simplicity of Javascript and it's most useful aplication was to useit on the web. The only models I have here are from some challenges I found online

## WEB

## Java

The main reason I started using Java, even tough everyone arround me and aparently everyone on the internet hating on it. It was the first language that I found with the same aspects that I found in Python. Those beeing: 

- The hability to run easely on many devices;
- A simple graphical library to migrate from pygame;

This, and by being faster than python based on some brief researches I've made by the time.

As you'll might realise, most of them were already made in python, just one project is "new" because, as I said, I only used it to have a better performance option for my python projects. 

But still, it was a pretty fun experience to use it. Not to mention that it helped me to better understand the concept of OOP, that I barrely used on my early-stage projects.

## ESP

This is my most recent "branch" of knownledge, in fact, I started learning about it 2 weeks before creating this git branch. I don't have much to say about it but I'll share my first contact with it.g
