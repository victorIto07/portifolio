<p>
For the time I have been learning to code, my main inspiration to learn more and more about it, was to merge fun with knownledge. So, throughout the years I've made some little projects in some different languages and libraries wich was certanly the way I've learned the most. In this repo, I'm just displaying some of those little projects as a (sort of) showcase.

> Note: Most of my most recent projects were lost by a corruption I had on my computer, the ones here are mostly from a backup that I managed to recover.

> Important: I have **not** changed the code itself. The structure and errors occuring by the time remain the same. But I did change some little things, like personal/sensitive data, erros caused by version and rename the files to something understandable since most of the names were nonsense because I didn't care much abaut it by the time.

## Python
This was the first language that I came across when trying to "learn how to code". I saw that it's decent for many aplications such as data, mobile aplications, backend services, game development, and all of it with a with a friendly learning curve.


Most of my time learning was spent with Python for it's simplicity. So, when I come across a new idea, concept or algorithm, I tend to have my first contact with it with Python.


Most of my projects are graphical ones becouse, as I said, I like learning by having fun. So, I highly recomend installing some of those libraries if you want to have a look into the codes:

```bash
$ pip install pygame pynput pyautogui opencv-python
```

Inside every folder there is going to be a "main.py" file, aways execute the program by it. Inside it there is going to be a brief resume about what the code was suposed to be, and what it current does(if it's not working properly)

PS: A big thank you to <a href=https://github.com/DaFluffyPotato>DaFluffyPotato</a> and 
<a href=https://www.youtube.com/@TheCodingTrain>TheCodingTrain</a>, those are the two main sources of ideas and tutorials that I followed along during my first projects.

## NodeJS
I stumbled across NodeJS on my fist job, where it was pretty much **needed** since I was going to use mostly Typescript, wich I've never used by this point.


By working with Typescript/Javascript most of my time working, I have deveolped a high bond with it to a general purpose usage like trying to solve some challanges, testing algorithms and concepts.

<br/>

## WEB Development

You've probably gotten here by It, but anyways, my only own code that I have available to show is my actual portifolio made with Angular.js.
I've worked with it since 2021 so I have a somewhere decent knowledge with webdevelopment. Most of it by using Angular.js as the frontend framework, Express, as a backend solution using Typescript/Javascript, and for the database, SQL Server by Microsoft.

For most of my time working, I've used those technologies all day so, with them, I also made my portifolio.

<br/>

## Java

The main reason I started using Java, even tough everyone arround me and aparently everyone on the internet hating on it. It was the first language that I found with the same aspects that I found in Python. Those beeing: 

- The hability to run easely on many devices;
- A simple graphical library to migrate from pygame;

This, and by being faster than python based on some brief researches I've made by the time.

As you'll might realise, most of them were already made in python, just one project is "new" because, as I said, I only used it to have a better performance option for my python projects. 

But still, it was a pretty fun experience to use it. Not to mention that it helped me to better understand the concept of OOP, that I barrely used on my early-stage projects.

</br>

**To run all codes:**
```bash
$ npm run dev
```

## ESP

This is my most recent "branch" of knownledge, in fact, I started learning about it 2 weeks before creating this git branch. I don't have much to say about it but I'll share my first contact with it.
