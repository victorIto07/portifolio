For the time I have been learning to code, my main inspiration to learn more and more was to merge fun with knownledge. So, throughout the years I've made some little projects in some different languages and libraries wich was certanly the way I've learned the most. In this repo, I'm just displaying some of those little projects as a (sort of) showcase.
